#### Goal
Utilize tools like Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP to conduct dynamic analysis of the application during runtime. This step focuses on identifying vulnerabilities that manifest when the application is actively processing data, simulating user interactions, and managing data flow between different application components.

#### How to Execute

1. **Setup Dynamic Testing Environment**
   - **Description:** Prepare a testing environment that closely mirrors the production environment to ensure that the dynamic analysis accurately reflects the applicationâ€™s behavior under real-world conditions.
   - **Tools/Techniques:**
     - Configure proxy tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to intercept and manipulate web traffic.
     - Set up a controlled test environment that includes all relevant application components and data flows.
   - **Output:** A fully configured dynamic testing environment ready for live vulnerability assessment.

2. **Conduct Live Application Tests**
   - **Description:** Perform tests that simulate real user interactions with the application to uncover vulnerabilities such as session hijacking, authentication bypass, and other security flaws that could be exploited during normal application operations.
   - **Tools/Techniques:**
     - Use Burp Suite for manual testing and automated scanning, applying its various tools like the Repeater and Intruder to test different security scenarios.
     - Employ OWASP ZAP for automated vulnerability scanning and spidering capabilities to identify security issues across the application.
   - **Output:** A detailed report of vulnerabilities discovered during dynamic analysis, providing insights into potential security breaches and operational weaknesses.

3. **Analyze and Document Findings**
   - **Description:** Analyze the results from the dynamic testing to identify actionable vulnerabilities and eliminate false positives. Document these findings comprehensively to prepare for remediation and further review.
   - **Tools/Techniques:**
     - Review the vulnerabilities detected by the dynamic analysis tools to determine their severity and the context in which they occur.
     - Use a documentation tool such as DefectDojo to log and categorize each finding, including detailed descriptions, potential impact, and recommended corrective actions.
   - **Output:** Well-documented findings from dynamic analysis, categorized and stored in a central repository for subsequent validation and remediation processes.
