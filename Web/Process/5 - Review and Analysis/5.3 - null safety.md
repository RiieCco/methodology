### Goal
The goal of the Null Safety activity is to ensure the application robustly handles null parameters across all stages of operation, from data input through backend processing. This activity focuses on mitigating the risk of null pointer exceptions and other null-related issues that can compromise application stability and security, potentially leading to crashes or vulnerabilities such as denial of service. By rigorously evaluating and enhancing how the application addresses null values—whether in the codebase or during live interactions—this activity aims to strengthen the application’s reliability and safeguard it against errors and attacks that exploit insufficient null handling practices.

#### How to Execute
- **Description:** Examine how the application deals with null parameters in both the code and during runtime interactions. This analysis is aimed at preventing null pointer exceptions and related issues that can lead to application crashes or security vulnerabilities such as denial of service.
- **Tools/Techniques:**
	- **Code Review:** Manually inspect areas of the code that handle data inputs, API calls, and inter-component communications to identify if null values are appropriately checked and handled before use.
	- **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static code analysis tools that can detect potential null dereferences or unsafe null handling practices. These tools can help pinpoint where null safety checks might be missing or improperly implemented.
	- **Dynamic Testing:** Conduct tests during runtime to see how the application behaves when it encounters null inputs. This involves manually inputting null values in various fields and observing how the application processes them.
	- **Unit Testing:** Implement or review existing unit tests to ensure they cover scenarios where null values are passed to the methods expected to handle such cases. Ensure that these tests validate the application’s ability to handle nulls without crashing.
- **Output:** A comprehensive analysis report detailing how the application handles null parameters, identifying any potential risks associated with improper null handling. The report should include recommendations for improving null safety, such as implementing null checks, using default values, or applying the Null Object design pattern where appropriate.
