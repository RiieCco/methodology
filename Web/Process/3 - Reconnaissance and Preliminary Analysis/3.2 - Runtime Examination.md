#### Goal
The objective is to manually investigate critical runtime components and functionalities of the application to uncover vulnerabilities that manifest during its operation. This hands-on approach aims to identify issues with dynamic processes such as data handling by XML parsers, file uploads, and other runtime features.

#### How to Execute

1. **Identify Key Runtime Components**
   - **Description:** Manually identify and list the application components that are crucial during runtime, such as XML parsers, file upload mechanisms, authentication processes, and dynamic data processing modules.
   - **Tools/Techniques:**
     - Engage in exploratory testing sessions where team members interact with the application to map out how these components function under various conditions.
     - Use manual tracing of data flow during runtime to understand how data is handled and manipulated across different components.
   - **Output:** A detailed list and description of key runtime components, focusing on their functional roles and potential security concerns.
