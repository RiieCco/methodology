### **Analyze the Applicationâ€™s Codebase**

Below is an image that shows the `cyclomatic` and `cognitive` complexity scores of the code.
From the sonar docs we learn:
```Sonar documentation
How simple or complicated the control flow of the application is. Cyclomatic Complexity measures the minimum number of test cases required for full test coverage. Cognitive Complexity is a measure of how difficult the application is to understand
```
We can use this score to determine if there is a high probability for flaws in the business logic of the application. Behind all the files/folders we see the overall score. The higher this value, the more this piece of code becomes a contender for review. 

Since this was a rather small application the scores were not really THAT interesting, but for larger code bases this is a really important tool in your recon arsenal.

The images below also show another handy feature of SonarQube namely `Security Hotspots`.
although we have different tooling for SAST (Semgrep) as discussed later on. It is always a good practise to have different tooling perform security checks since there might be a discrepancy on on what specific points the tooling excels to test on.

For now lets again add this finding to our RTM for later verification

### **Examine Application Routing**

The routes of the application tell us a lot about the attack surface and could potentially point to interesting paths to check. In a lot of scenario's we could i.i.e find paths here that have special roles/privileges or handle requests with a different `authentication/authorization` middleware. 
```node
router.post('/api/login', async (req, res) => {
```

```node
router.get('/interface', AuthMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
```

```node
router.post('/api/activity', AuthMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
```

```node
router.get('/logout', (req, res) => {
```

Another way to find interesting `routes` or even other interesting files, backups, documentation could be running `gobuster` against the target.
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.50.242 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x txt,pdf,config,zip
```

### **Identification of Business-Critical Code Sections**
In this context we primarily want to focus on the authentication part of the application alongside the potential for the RCE. With all the information currently at our disposal these should be our primary focus.
